                    <h1>Scientist's Guide to Keograms</h1>
                    <p>This page demonstrates the use of keograms when checking for data availability or searching for interesting events.
                        A keogram is a time-versus-latitude plot created from the individual 
                        images captured during the night. They yield information of the 
                        auroral activity during the whole night in one easily transferable
                        image. The current all-sky stations run by FMI produce keograms
                        every day, and new data are placed in WWW for public access as
                        soon as possible.</p>
                    <p>Keograms can be considered images from imaging photometers - the 
                        pixel column corresponds to the latitude coverage of the 
                        all-sky camera. In case of cameras with filters and a filter 
                        wheel, we usually create the keograms from the wavelength of 
                        557.7nm (ie. green line). Colour images naturally result in 
                        colour keograms.</p>
                    <p>Please note that the instructions here should be considered 
                        guidelines. You should first use common sense in combining 
                        the tips below. Of course, for "real interpretation" we need 
                        to use the actual images.</p>
