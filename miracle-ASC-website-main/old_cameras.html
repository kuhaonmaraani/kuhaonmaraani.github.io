                <h1>Intensified all-sky imagers</h1>
                <p>The all-sky imagers that were operated by FMI until 2007 used intensified all-sky cameras
                    which have been manufactured by KeoConsultants. Each imager had telecentric 
                    and non-vignetting optics, and the field of view of the fish-eye lens was 180 degrees.
                    The filter wheel had seven slots for narrow bandwidth interference filters. 
                    In normal operation one filter holder was empty to allow acquiring non-filtered, 
                    star images, which were used for geometric calibration. Every station had filters 
                    for green, blue, and red line emission.
                    </p>
                <p>The faint images were intensified before the final image was acquired by the 
                    CCD camera (B&W) and digitised by the frame grabber card of the station 
                    computer. This intensification allows shorter exposure times with less expensive 
                    CCD cameras, and typically an exposure takes 500ms. A standard imaging sequence 
                    included one green line image every 20 sec, and one blue and red line image 
                    every 60 sec. Non-filtered images were taken at least once an hour. All 
                    images were stored in 8-bit JPG format with 512x512 pixel resolution. The 
                    operation of the imager was controlled by the station computer of the all-sky 
                    camera station.</p>

                <h1>Old all-sky mirror cameras</h1>
                <p>The "historical" all-sky cameras used a downward-looking film camera and a 
                    spherical mirror to image the whole sky. There were also three light standards 
                    and a small display that were imaged at the same time.
                    There were no filters, and the colours depended on the type of film 
                    that is used. The light standards had a known "colour" and could be used 
                    in calibrating the results.</p>
                <p>Normally the camera took one image per minute, but it was possible to take 
                    images every 20 seconds (for campaigns etc.). There were a couple of fixed 
                    exposure times; mostly an exposure of two seconds was used and every tenth 
                    image was exposed longe</p>
                <p>The operation of the imager is started and stopped manually, and after the 
                    film is full, one has to develop it before use. The films are the copied 
                    to video tapes from which interesting events are digitised for computer use.</p>
                <br>
                <h1>FMI mirror camera sample images</h1>
                <p>The images taken by the historical cameras (used before 1996) contain 
                    information about the date and time when the image was taken. Also, 
                    three light standards were also imaged. Note that because this camera 
                    construction used a spherical mirror the camera blocked the centre of 
                    the image. Thus the green light standard could be placed in the middle 
                    of the spherical mirror without losing important details from the zenith</p>
                <p>The sample images here have been compressed with lossy compressing 
                    JPEG-compression. This means that small details in the images are lost but that 
                    the compression ratio is larger.</p>

                <h1>Colour all-sky cameras</h1>
                <p>In 2007 FMI purchased two color cameras which replaced the intensified 
                    CCD cameras at Kevo and Muonio. The images are read in a fast mode 
                    which includes binning in one direction. An additional colour 
                    conversion is needed to produce full colour 8-bit jpg images. 
                    Due to the broad-band colour matrix integrated on the CCD these 
                    instruments capture all light within the visible wavelength range, 
                    and are thus very sensitive to light pollution. More detailed 
                    description of the ASC colour conversion can be found in 
                    <a href="https://spie.org/Publications/Proceedings/Paper/10.1117/12.617801?SSO=1">Syrj√§suo et al</a>. </p>
