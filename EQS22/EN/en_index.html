    <h1>PHYSICS STUDENT ORGANISATIONS' EQUALITY, BULLYING, AND 
      HARASSMENT SURVEY 2022 </h1>
    
    <div class="container">

    <h2 class="banner">Introduction</h2>

    <p>In December last year the equality resposibles 
        of Resonanssi, Meridiaani and Synop conducted a survey about equality, 
        bullying and harassment in the physics student community. Here are the results 
        of the survey. Suomennos löytyy <a href="../index.html" style="font-size: 15px;">täältä</a>. - June, 2023</p>

        <h2>The survey</h2>

        <p>The survey was conducted in November and December 2022. We had 67 responses in total 
        from all organisations. The survey was open for almost 5 weeks and it was available 
        in English and Finnish. It was advertised to all students in all three 
        organisations.</p> 

        <p>The survey consisted of 6 topics: Accessibility, Equality of servings in events, and Equality in the physics community. 
        In the first section questions were asked separately for each organisation,
        but the rest of the sections' questions regarded the community of all
        three organisations as a whole. Most questions were posed so that the answers were
        either Yes/No/Maybe -type or a suitable number on a scale of 0-5.</p>

        <p class="vline"></p>
          
        <h2>Instructions to the visualisations</h2>
          
        <p>Everything is 
        colour-coded: shades of pink means the data are associated with Resonanssi, 
        yellow with Synop and blue with Meridiaani. Green is associated with all 
        organisations. The visualisations might not work properly when using a mobile device or 
        cropping the browser window. You can find more information about each dashboard by clicking 
        the 'View caption' button below the dashboard.</p>
      
        <p>Bear in mind that thise results are directive and to be taken with a grain of
          salt since there were only 67 responses. Most questions were about the community
          as a whole so even though you can filter answers by organisation, the resulting
          visualisations may not correspond to one organisation. IDK means I don't know/they didn't 
          answer and IDWS means I don't want to say. If you have any questions, feel free to ask 
          Mara (maria.e.virtanen@helsinki.fi, she/her) who has created these visualisations.</p>

        <p id="cap1" class="caption">The first pie chart, with title "I'm most active in", shows the distribution of organisations  of the respondents.
          These values are calculated according to the level of activeness and role in each organisation that the respondants reported.
          IDK stands for "I don't know", meaning that there was no single organisation that the
          respondent was the most active in. "No. responses" stands for number of responses, the value of which
          tells the total number of responses correlating to the field. The other charts show
          the gender distribution, age distribution and starting year distribution of respondents. IDWS stands for "I don't want to say".</p>

        <p id="cap2" class="caption">Accessibility statements and Registration accessibility and equality show how the respondents agree with the given statemets, 1=strongly disagree and 5=strongly agree.
          The plotted value is an average value taken over all responses. Accessibility of spaces shows how the respondents rated the accessibility of our most used spaces on a scale [1,5], 1=Not accessible at all and 5=Very accessible.
          This value is also an average taken over all responses. Lastly, Accessibility of events in general shows how the respondents
          rated our events' accessibility in general, with the average taken over all responses shown in the middle of the chart.</p>

        <p id="cap3" class="caption">Events I wish to be organised more shows how many respondents wishes different types of events to
          be more organised. Starting year of studies and I'm most active in are included to enable interactivity.</p>

        <button onclick="showCap('31')" id="capbut31">View caption</button>
        <p id="cap31" class="caption">The first four donut charts show how the respondents rated non-alcoholic 
          beverages in events from 1 to 5, 1 being bad and 5 being good. An average rating is shown in the middle of each chart.
          On the lower right corner there are two corresponding charts for food ratings. Lastly, the Skipped events chart shows 
          how many respondents have skipped an event and how often due to having dietary restrictions and feeling like they
          shouldn't attend because of it.</p>

          bullying and harassment situations they've seen or experienced from 1 to 5, 1=not severe and 5=very severe. 
          The last donut chart shows how the repondents rated how harassment contact persons managed from 1 to 5, 
          1=very badly and 5=very well. Reason of bullying shows how many respondents reported different attributes
          to be the reason for the bullying they've seen or experienced. The last bar charts show how many respondents
          reported that the bullying or harassment was addressed or interviened by others.</p>

        <p id="cap4" class="caption">The first chart shows if the respondents found the atmosphere open and exciting in each organisation. 1=agree, -1=disagree and 0=neutral.
          The value is an average calculated over all non-zero responses. "Most active in" is included for interactivity. The bar charts 
          on the bottom half show what proportion of respondents hasn't seen or experienced bullying or harassment. 
          The charts are separated by the "I'm most active in"-value. Please note that the respondents didn't report in which organisation 
          the bullying or harassment did/didn't happen, so these charts are only suggestive. A respondent that's most active in one organisation could 
          be bullied or harassed in another etc.</p>

          statements: "I feel safe in the organisation and its events", "The actives, officials, board members and 
          other members are equal" and "I'm not scared or anxious to participate in the organisation's events and activities". 
          1=agree, -1=disagree, 0=neutral. The plotted value is averaged over non-zero values. The last chart shows how the 
          respondents rated the community's general success in equality and accessibility. The chart 
          is grouped by the "I'm most active in"-field but bear in mind that the rating was given to the whole community. Plotted value is 
          an average taken over all values, 1=Much to improve, 5=Not much to improve.</p>
