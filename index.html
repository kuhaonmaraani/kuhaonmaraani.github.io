    <p class="banner">3 things you should know before releasing your movie in Finland</p>

    <p class="intro">Picking just the right date for your movie release is a challenging task. When are the audiences craving a cinematic experience in the movie theater? Should you release your movie during the peak Oscars season when audiences are on the move or wait for the summer and minimize the competition? With our tips the decision will get easier and more profitable.</p>

        <h1>01</h1>
        <h2>Think about seasons</h3>
          <p>It's obvious: Christmas movies are released around Christmas and horror movies around Halloween, but what about other genres? There are two high seasons in the year for releasing movies. First is known as the 'Oscar season' meaning that a lot of movies are released before Oscars so that the chances of winning awards are higher. Another important event is the Cannes film festival, held in late May.</p>
          <p>Now, there are two ways to go here: you could either choose to release your movie during a high season (late spring or towards the end of the year) or during so-called dump months (beginning of the year and summer). During high seasons movie goers are active, but there's a lot of competition since a lot of movies are being released. During dump months, there isn't much competition, but it's risky since they are called dump months for a reason. However, one of the most successful movies was released during dump months, The Titanic; proving that it might be worth taking a risk.</p> 
         <p style="margin-bottom: 15vw;">According to our research, the most lucrative seasons are towards the end of the year, especially the month of December. An interesting find was that the middle of the summer seems to be a lucrative season as well.  The start of the year is the opposite: especially the month of February seems to be a bad time to release a movie. Viewership wise the best seasons are also in December, but also in August. The worst seasons are in February and May. </p>
    
        <h1>02</h1>
        <h2>What about genres?</h2>
          <p style="margin-bottom: 15vw;">Does the genre of the movie affect its success? According to our research the most lucrative genres are adult, music, animation, family, and thriller. The worst genres are action, crime, sci-fi, fantasy, and history. Viewership wise the best genres are adult, music, animation, drama, and family. The worst genres are Sci-Fi, crime, action, war, and history. </p>
      
        <h1>03</h1>
        <h2>Don't worry about the weather!</h2>
          <p style="margin-bottom: 15vw;">Oh no! The release date is approaching, and the weather forecasts are predicting perfect summer beach days for the premier weekend or the most awful chilly rainy weather. Are people going to come to the movies or are they enjoying the sun or sitting at home with a cup of tea? Should you spend a bit more money on marketing to compensate for the possible loss of viewers? Don't worry, our research shows that weather doesn't really affect movie-goers. Spend your money somewhere else! </p>
